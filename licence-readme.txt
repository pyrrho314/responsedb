LICENCE LOG: version 9.0.0.0, October 6 2013

Paul Walker decides to share his code but doesn't want to share initial codebase, especially
since we envision a much more complicated tool.  I am going to make this plugin cooperative
with Paul.  I very much appreciate the example.  It's also hard to merge code that is just
started, but I think these plugins can cooperate and communicate in the future, as well
as share code.
